## Hi 👋

I’m **Grzegorz Żak**, a data analyst with experience in sales and profitability analysis,
as well as data modeling in **Excel, R, and Power BI**.

My main areas of interest include:
- **time series forecasting** (sales, demand, trends),
- **demographic and social data analysis**,
- **survey data analysis**, from exploratory analysis to proper interpretation of results.

I enjoy working with data that describes real-world phenomena and human behavior,
not just abstract numbers. I’m interested not only in **what is happening**,
but also **why it is happening** and **what is likely to happen next**.

On this website, I share:
- **analytical projects (case studies)**,
- **dashboards and data visualizations**,
- short methodological analyses and experiments.
